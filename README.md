## Description
The goal of this project was to create an application capable of building and saving a plan for the day in a given city. The activities returned by the search are "social-distancing" friendly, focused on the outdoors. The day can be built by the user clicking on either restaurants or attractions they would like to visit and building their "activity list". Once the activity list is built, these items can be clicked and dragged to the planner. The planner can also accept text that is typed directly by the user.
